# Daimo Remote Project

This library allows Daimo components to access remote services (in particular remote processor services).

## Features

The main features of this project include,

- Connection to [Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) to retreive remote service definition (via SOAP)
- Dynamic remote service stub generation (using [Apache CXF](http://cxf.apache.org/) client)
- Local invocation of remote service
